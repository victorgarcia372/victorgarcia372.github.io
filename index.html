    <h1>Welcome To Victors Programming Portfolio</h1>
 
  <p> This website is for my portfolio of programs that I have coded for CSC106 The Joy of Programming course at the University of Rhode Island. I wrote this page using the HTML programming language. I used GITHUB as a tool to create these webpages that are linked together using specific codes in order to get these end results.<br> Use the navigation buttons above to navigate through my web pages that I've created!
