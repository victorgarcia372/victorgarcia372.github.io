  <p> My name is Victor Garcia, I am a post graduate student at the University of Rhode Island. I graduted in the Spring of 2022 with a Bachelors in Accounting.

I am a follower of the Greenbay Packers, Mets and New York Knicks. I also won in both of my fantasy football leagues sitting at (1-0), and have great hopes for this season! I am the 2019-2020 league champion and hope to get my second ring soon!</p>
